## Welcome

The htmldocs API allows you to programatically generate PDF documents like invoices, reports, and forms. 
The API is built around REST principles. It uses resource-oriented URLs that are predictable, accepts form-encoded request bodies, and returns responses encoded in JSON. It also utilizes standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

## Authentication

To authenticate requests, the htmldocs API employs API keys. These keys can be managed and viewed in the [htmldocs dashboard](https://htmldocs.com/projects).

Bearer tokens are used for authentication, which can be set via the `Authorization` header.

Given the extensive privileges your API keys hold, it's crucial to keep them safe! Avoid sharing your secret API keys in areas that are publicly accessible, like GitHub, client-side code, etc.
