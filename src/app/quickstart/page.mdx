# Quickstart

This guide will walk you through a basic example of using Python to make an API call to generate a sample document.

## Create your first document

To get started, we'll need to create a document that we can use as a template. To do this, you'll first need to <a href="https://htmldocs.com/signup" target="_blank">create an account</a> on htmldocs. After, click on the **"Certificate"** template to create your first document.

## Add your first variable

In our next step, we'll add our first variable. We want to dynamically generate the certificate and swap out the name of the recipient. To do this, we'll replace "Elmer J. Fudd" with a variable called `name`.

<Note>
  Variables, loops, and conditions are defined using the Jinja2 templating language. <br/>
  You can learn more about Jinja2 <a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/" target="_blank">here</a>.

## What's next?

Great, you're now set up with an API client and have made your first request to the API. Here are a few links that might be handy as you venture further into the Protocol API:
