# Configuring multiple columns for print in HTML/CSS

When creating print documents like academic journals, brochures, and newspapers, it's common to use multiple columns to make the content more readable. In this guide, we'll look at how to configure multiple columns for print documents in HTML/CSS.

## Using the `column-count` property

The `column-count` property is used to specify the number of columns an element should be divided into. Here's an example of how to use it:

```css
.selector {
    column-count: 2;
}
```

Where `.selector` is the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.php" target="_blank">CSS selector</a> you want to apply the columns to, and `2` is the number of columns you want to divide the element into.

For example, let's consider this academic journal that we want to display in two columns:

<img src={before.src} alt="An academic journal template where the content is one column" className="w-full" />

Here, we want to apply the two-column layout _only_ on the body content and not the title or subtitle. When we uncomment the `column-count` selector from the `.content` class, we get the following result:

<img src={after.src} alt="An academic journal template where the content is two columns" className="w-full" />

The text is now divided into two columns, and will wrap after overflowing the first column, like a zig-zag pattern.

<img src={colWrap.src} alt="A visual showing text wrapping into the second column" className="h-[500px] w-auto" />

## Adjusting the gap between columns

The `column-gap` property is used to specify the gap between the columns. Here's an example of how to use it:

```css
.selector {
    column-count: 2;
    column-gap: 80px;
}
```

And the result, where we increase the gap between the columns to `80px`:

<img src={columnGap.src} alt="An academic journal template where the content is two columns with a gap of 80px" className="w-full" />


## Creating columns with `flex`

Sometimes, you might not want to wrap content in a column that overflows to the next column. <br/>
Instead, you might want to position elements side by side, like such:

<img src={flexCol.src} alt="Two images positioned side by side" className="h-[500px] w-auto" />

To do this, you can use the `flex` property to create columns. Here's an example of how to use it:

```css
.img-row {
    display: flex;
}
```

```html
<div class="img-row">
    <img src="image1.jpg" alt="Image 1" />
    <img src="image2.jpg" alt="Image 2" />
</div>
```

In this example, the `img-row` class is used to create a row of images. The `display: flex` property is used to make the images appear side by side.

You can further configure the layout using the following properties:

- **`flex-gap`**: Defines the space between flex items. It can be used to easily create consistent spacing between items in a flex container.
  ```css
  .img-row {
      display: flex;
      gap: 20px; /* This creates a 20px gap between each column */
  }
  ```

- **`align-items`**: Controls the alignment of items on the cross axis (perpendicular to the main axis, which is the horizontal axis in this case). 
  ```css
  .img-row {
      display: flex;
      align-items: center; /* This vertically centers items in the container */
  }
  ```

- **`justify-content`**: Controls the alignment of items on the main axis (horizontal in this case).
  ```css
  .img-row {
      display: flex;
      justify-content: space-between; /* This adds as much space as possible between the items */
      /* justify-content: center; // This horizontally centers the items */
  }
  ```

- **`flex-direction`**: Controls the direction in which the flex items are laid out. Set to `row` (horizontal) by default. Changing this to `column` will invert the `align-items` and `justify-content` properties.
  ```css
  .img-row {
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: column; /* This lays out the items in a column instead, creating a vertical layout */
  }
  ```
